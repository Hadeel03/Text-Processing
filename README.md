# Text-Processing

## Overview
* This program is written in Python.
* Classes, methods, and functions are used.

## Part A
1. Write a method/function that reads a text file:
    * Returns a list of tokens.
        * For the purpose of this project, a token is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, independent of capitalization.
        * I'll be using regular expressions by including the `re` library.
        * NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is not allowed, as it ruins the purpose of tokenizing from scratch.
2. Write a method/function that counts each token in the token list:
    * Not allowed to import a counter; it must be done from scratch.
3. Write a method that prints out the word frequency count on the screen:
    * Ordered by decreased frequency, meaning the highest frequency words go first.
    * Use any of the following formats for the output:
    <token>\t<freq>
    <token> <freq>
    <token> - <freq>
    <token> = <freq>
    <token> > <freq>
    <token> -> <freq>
    <token> => <freq>
